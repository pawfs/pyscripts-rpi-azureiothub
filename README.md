# scripts-rpi-azureiothub

These scripts are separate programs each testing a certain functionality related to the temperature sensor or Azure IoT Hub from the client side (the Raspberry Pi).

Before running the program, run this command from the command prompt :

cmd/sh pip3 install azure-iot-device

The keys used in the project are no longer functional make sure you change them if you want to test.

Used the Azure IoT Hub python samples (client side) for reference.
